# Use Odin as language of choice

## Context and Problem Statement

A ray tracer commands a low level language. Elixir is not an option.

## Considered Options

* Rust
 - Have started before, got lost in the weeds in macros
* Zig
 - Have started before, but struggled with syntax
* Odin
 - Have not tried much before
 - The principles behind it's design are interesting
 - Focused on graphics, so built in matrices support that I can migrate to after I finish the book
## Decision Outcome

Odin
