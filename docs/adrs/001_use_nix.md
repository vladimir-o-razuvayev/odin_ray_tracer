# Use nix for package management & building

## Context and Problem Statement

Difficulties with coming back to old projects that relied on homebrew, asdf, etc.
Want to be able to set it up once, then use easily.

## Considered Options

* asdf
* homebrew
* nix

## Decision Outcome

Went with nix as a learning exercise.
